==========================
Quest To The Fake Object !
==========================


    This is a toy game for understanding how mock and other test libs work.


Quickstart :
 - run the external API using ./src/external_service/run.sh
 - issue *qttfo* once the WSGI server is running.

Incepted for the Python Grenoble Meetup on Nov 2022.

As a reminder, this project is not intended to be fully test-covered. Add more
meat if you really like it.

So long and thank for all the fish !
