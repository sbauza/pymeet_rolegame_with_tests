==========================
Quest To The Fake Object !
==========================


    This is a toy game for understanding how mock and other test libs work.



Incepted for the Python Grenoble Meetup on Nov 2022.

As a reminder, this project is not intended to be fully test-covered. Add more
meat if you really like it.

So long and thank for all the fish !
